Exar xr21v141x UART driver
==========================

The source code here comes from the Exar website, downloaded on 2 June 2014.

It has been updated to work with the Linux kernel tty API. I have tested it on
3.13.

To build, ensure you have kernel headers and a compiler installed:

$ sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic build-essential

$ cd exar-uart-driver
$ make
$ sudo make modules_install

You will need to complete the make && sudo make install step whenever your
kernel is updated.
